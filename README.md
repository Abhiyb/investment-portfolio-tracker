## 💻 GitHub Collaboration Workflow
All team members will push code to their own branches. Pull Requests (PRs) must be reviewed and merged by another team member, not the person who raised the PR.

### 🔁 Git Workflow

``` bash
# Clone the repository (only the first time)
git clone https://github.com/darshan2156/investment-portfolio-tracker.git

cd investment-portfolio-tracker


# Create and switch to your feature branch
git checkout -b your-name/feature-name


# Make your changes, then commit and push
git add .

git commit -m "Add: feature description here"

git push origin your-name/feature-name
``` 

### 📌 Pull Request (PR) Process

1. Go to GitHub and create a Pull Request from your branch to the main branch.

2. Another team member, not the person who raised the PR will review the code, request changes if needed, and merge approved PRs.

3. Everyone must regularly pull latest changes from the main branch to keep their branch up to date:

``` bash
git checkout main
git pull origin main
```
